    "text": "What is DataFest?\nBrought to you by the American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Davidson College Department of Data Science, DataFest is a data analysis competition in which teams of students have 48 hours to analyze a large, complex dataset and find the stories hidden within. Hosted at colleges and universities across the country every spring, Davidson’s own DataFest brings together students with mentors from the faculty and local companies, offering not only guidance and fellowship, but also networking and recruitment opportunities!\nAt the end of the event, each team gets a few minutes to present their findings to a panel of judges, and prizes are given for the best work!"

    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n\n\n\nWho can participate in DataFest?\n\n\n\nDataFest is open to all currently-enrolled Davidson students. We want a diverse group representing various majors, class years, and skill levels to participate!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much does DataFest cost?\n\n\n\nParticipation in DataFest is 100% free to Davidson students! Our sponsors and the Data Science department will provide meals, snacks, and drinks for all participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I bring to DataFest?\n\n\n\nBring your laptop and charger, a water bottle, and any other essentials you might need for a full day of building cool stuff with data!\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need a team?\n\n\n\nWhile DataFest does organize students into teams of three, we do not require you to bring your own team with you. If you show up solo, we will find a team for you! But you can also form your own team prior to DataFest if you like by adding your teammates’ names on the registration form.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill there be prizes?\n\n\n\nYes! We have three award categories: (1) Best Visualization, (2) Best Use of External Data, and (3) Best in Show. Teams who are awarded any of these categories on the final day of DataFest will receive a prize!"
