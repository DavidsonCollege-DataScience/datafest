20 students from across Davidson College came together to analyze real estate data, enjoy good food, and network with employers in the Charlotte area!

Hosted at the [Jay Hurt Hub for Innovation and Entrepreneurship](https://hurthub.davidson.edu/){target="_blank"} from April 4-6, this was Davidson's first post-COVID DataFest event, and the first since the formation of the college's [Department of Data Science](https://www.davidson.edu/academic-departments/data-science){target="_blank"}!
